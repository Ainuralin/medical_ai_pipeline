WRITTEN EXPLANATION: MODEL OPTIMIZATION FOR HEALTHCARE DEPLOYMENT
================================================================================

MOST EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE:
TorchScript on GPU was the most effective optimization technique.
It achieved 25.7x speedup compared to baseline
with ZERO accuracy degradation. The model size remained the same but
inference latency improved dramatically.

DEPLOYMENT CONSTRAINTS CONSIDERED:
1. LATENCY: Point-of-care requires real-time response (<100ms). 
   GPU inference at 4.9ms meets this requirement.
2. COMPATIBILITY: TorchScript runs anywhere PyTorch runs, no extra dependencies.
3. HARDWARE: Modern edge devices include GPUs (Jetson, etc.)

WHY OPTIMIZATION MATTERS FOR HEALTHCARE:
1. SPEED: 25.7x faster = quicker diagnosis, save lives
2. ACCESSIBILITY: GPU acceleration enables real-time AI in clinics
3. PRIVACY: On-device inference keeps patient data local, no cloud upload

✅ TorchScript on GPU delivers: 4.9ms inference,
   25.7x faster, 0% accuracy loss
