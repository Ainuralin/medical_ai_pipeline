WRITTEN REFLECTION: TRAINING CHALLENGES & PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

BIGGEST TRAINING CHALLENGE:
The most difficult challenge was preventing mode collapse in the GAN. Initially,
after 10-15 epochs, the generator would collapse to producing only 1-2 types of
MRI images (mostly notumor class). The discriminator became too strong, causing
vanishing gradients and halting learning.

SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:
I addressed this through multiple strategies: (1) Added dropout (0.25) to the
discriminator to prevent overfitting, (2) Implemented label smoothing (0.9/0.1)
to provide better gradient signals, (3) Used LeakyReLU instead of ReLU to avoid
dead neurons, and (4) Added Gaussian noise to discriminator inputs. These
changes stabilized training and maintained diversity throughout 30 epochs.

PRIVACY BENEFITS:
Synthetic medical data generation is crucial for privacy preservation. The GAN
produces entirely artificial brain MRI images that contain NO real patient data.
These synthetic images can be freely shared, used for research, and augment
datasets without HIPAA violations or patient consent issues. This is especially
valuable for rare tumor types where collecting sufficient real data is
challenging. Additionally, synthetic data can balance class distributions and
reduce demographic biases without exposing sensitive patient information.
