TRAINING CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS - GAN FOR BRAIN MRI
================================================================================

CHALLENGE 1: MODE COLLAPSE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROBLEM:
• Generator started producing only 1-2 types of MRI images
• Discriminator loss dropped to near zero
• Lack of diversity in generated samples

SOLUTIONS APPLIED:
1. Added Dropout layers in discriminator (0.25)
2. Used label smoothing (valid = 0.9, fake = 0.1)
3. Implemented learning rate scheduling
4. Increased latent dimension to 100

RESULT: Mode collapse resolved - diverse brain MRI generations

CHALLENGE 2: DISCRIMINATOR OVERFITTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROBLEM:
• Discriminator loss approached 0 too quickly
• Generator gradients vanished
• No learning progress after 10 epochs

SOLUTIONS APPLIED:
1. Added noise to discriminator inputs (0.1 * Gaussian)
2. Reduced discriminator learning rate
3. Added spectral normalization
4. Balanced G/D training frequency (1:1 ratio)

RESULT: Stable GAN training throughout 30 epochs

CHALLENGE 3: VANISHING GRADIENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROBLEM:
• Generator gradients near zero
• No improvement in image quality

SOLUTIONS APPLIED:
1. Switched from Sigmoid to Tanh in generator output
2. Used LeakyReLU instead of ReLU
3. Added BatchNorm layers
4. Initialized weights with Normal(0, 0.02)

RESULT: Stable gradient flow, continuous improvement

STRATEGIES USED TO STABILIZE TRAINING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ DCGAN architecture guidelines
✓ BatchNorm in generator (not discriminator)
✓ LeakyReLU activation (α=0.2)
✓ Adam optimizer (β1=0.5, β2=0.999)
✓ Learning rate: 0.0002
✓ Weight initialization: N(0, 0.02)
✓ Label smoothing: 0.9/0.1
✓ Input noise: Gaussian (σ=0.1)
✓ Dropout in discriminator: 0.25
